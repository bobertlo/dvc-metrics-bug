This is just the pipeline code I have put together to make my reproducible pipelines. I am not
planning to host sample data. If you put some images in a couple directories in `data/test1` they
will be able to run a pipeline.

To create the `dvc.yaml`, run `make` or write the output of `gen-dvc-yaml.py` to `dvc.yaml`.
